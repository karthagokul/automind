# AutoMind

**AutoMind** is an open-source, lightweight automotive diagnostics assistant powered by a small language model (LLM). It runs locally within a vehicleâ€™s infotainment system or a connected mobile device to interpret Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), offer intuitive explanations, suggest fixes, and guide drivers in real time â€” even without internet connectivity.


##  Why AutoMind?

Modern vehicles generate hundreds of cryptic fault codes like `P0171` or `P0420` that leave drivers guessing. AutoMind bridges that gap by translating these codes into plain, actionable language, safety advisories, and next steps.

### Key Value Propositions:

-   Translates generic and brand-specific fault codes into human-friendly explanations    
-   Provides actionable troubleshooting advice on the go    
-   Works offline, integrated directly into the infotainment system    
-   Learns from historical fault trends to improve recommendations    
-   Extensible and customizable per car brand
    

## Features

-   Interprets generic OBD-II and brand-specific DTCs    
-   Runs a fine-tuned, compact LLM optimized for automotive diagnostics    
-   Supports text and voice interactions (planned)    
-   Integrates with OBD-II readers via Bluetooth, WiFi, or directly over CAN Bus    
-   Works locally on-device, ensuring data privacy and reliability    
-   Recommends actionable fixes and safety advisories    
-   Extensible, community-supported fault code database    

## How It Works

1.  **OBD-II or CAN Bus Data Capture**: Reads real-time fault codes from vehicle systems
    
2.  **LLM Inference Engine**: A lightweight language model interprets the code and its context
    
3.  **Response Generation**: Produces clear explanations and repair suggestions
    
4.  **Driver Interface**: Displays or speaks the result via the infotainment system
    
## CAN Bus Real-time Integration (Planned)

In production, AutoMind will bypass OBD-II polling and read fault codes **directly from the vehicleâ€™s CAN Bus network** via the infotainment systemâ€™s internal CAN interface.  
This enables real-time, seamless fault detection and contextual driver guidance without external adapters.

**Advantages:**

-   Faster and continuous diagnostics
    
-   Access to proprietary, non-OBD fault messages
    
-   Cleaner integration into infotainment UI/UX
    

**Example:**  
On detecting a DTC message over CAN:

-   Parse message ID and payload
    
-   Query the onboard LLM
    
-   Display diagnosis + recommended actions

## Getting Started (Development Simulation)

> **Note:** The full simulation runs locally on your machine using Python and a compact LLM (e.g. `TinyLLaMA`, `Phi-2`, `Gemma-2B`)

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `transformers`, `torch`, `obd` (for OBD-II simulation)
- Access to fault code dataset (JSON format)

### Installation

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automind.git
    cd automind
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python automind_simulator.py

This will simulate fault code inputs and LLM-generated outputs.

##  LLM Fine-Tuning & Dataset

We use a dataset consisting of:

-   Generic OBD-II fault codes (P0xxx, P1xxx, etc.)
    
-   Toyota-specific codes (example set for demo)
    
-   Human-readable explanations
    
-   Suggested repair steps
    

**Example Entry:**

    `{  "code":  "P0171",  "meaning":  "System Too Lean (Bank 1)",  "explanation":  "Indicates an air/fuel mixture imbalance on Bank 1.",  "action":  "Inspect for vacuum leaks, clean MAF sensor, check fuel pressure."  }`

**Fine-tuning instructions and scripts will be provided soon.**

## Roadmap

-   Fault code lookup + explanation module
    
-   Voice assistant integration (offline)
    
-   CAN Bus direct interfacing
    
-   Multi-brand DTC support
    
-   Historical fault trend analysis
    
-   Community-contributed code database
