# ðŸš˜ AutoMind

**AutoMind** is an open-source, lightweight automotive diagnostics assistant powered by a small language model (LLM). It runs locally within a vehicleâ€™s infotainment system or on a connected mobile device to interpret Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), offer intuitive explanations, suggest fixes, and guide drivers in real time â€” even without internet connectivity.

##  Why AutoMind?

Modern vehicles generate hundreds of fault codes â€” most drivers have no clue what those cryptic `P0171` or `P0420` codes mean. AutoMind bridges that gap by turning those codes into plain language insights, safety advisories, and next steps.

**Key Value Propositions:**
-  Translates OBD-II fault codes into human-friendly explanations
- Provides actionable troubleshooting advice
- Works offline, integrated into infotainment systems
- Learns from historical fault trends over time
- Brand-specific fault code support (customizable per car model)

## Features

- Interprets generic OBD-II and brand-specific fault codes
- Runs a fine-tuned, compact LLM optimized for automotive context
- Supports voice and text interactions (planned)
- Integrates with OBD-II readers via Bluetooth, WiFi, or CAN Bus
- Works locally, ensuring data privacy and reliability
- Provides recommended fixes and safety advisories
- Extensible fault code database for multiple car brands

## How It Works

1. **OBD-II Data Capture:** Reads real-time fault codes via standard OBD-II interface
2. **LLM Inference Engine:** A fine-tuned lightweight language model interprets the code context
3. **Response Generation:** Generates an explanation and repair suggestion in plain language
4. **Driver Interface:** Displays or speaks the result through the car infotainment system

## Getting Started (Development Simulation)

> **Note:** The full simulation runs locally on your machine using Python and a compact LLM (e.g. `TinyLLaMA`, `Phi-2`, `Gemma-2B`)

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `transformers`, `torch`, `obd` (for OBD-II simulation)
- Access to fault code dataset (JSON format)

### Installation

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automind.git
    cd automind
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python automind_simulator.py

This will simulate fault code inputs and LLM-generated outputs.

##  LLM Fine-Tuning & Dataset

We use a dataset consisting of:

-   Generic OBD-II fault codes (P0xxx, P1xxx, etc.)
    
-   Toyota-specific codes (example set for demo)
    
-   Human-readable explanations
    
-   Suggested repair steps
    

**Example Entry:**

    `{  "code":  "P0171",  "meaning":  "System Too Lean (Bank 1)",  "explanation":  "Indicates an air/fuel mixture imbalance on Bank 1.",  "action":  "Inspect for vacuum leaks, clean MAF sensor, check fuel pressure."  }`

**Fine-tuning instructions and scripts will be provided soon.**

## Roadmap

-   Fault code lookup + explanation module
    
-   Voice assistant integration (offline)
    
-   CAN Bus direct interfacing
    
-   Multi-brand DTC support
    
-   Historical fault trend analysis
    
-   Community-contributed code database
