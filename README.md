## Overview

**Automind** is an embedded AI-powered safety advisor for vehicles that operates **fully offline** on automotive-grade hardware. It combines the **semantic precision of Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** with the **language fluency of quantized Large Language Models (LLMs)** to deliver **proactive, explainable, and context-aware safety alerts** to drivers.

Unlike traditional ADAS systems which react to events, Automind **anticipates hazards** by reasoning over real-time telemetry, regulations, road conditions, and environment—all without cloud dependency.

## Key Features

- **Embedded & Offline**: Runs on in-vehicle units like Qualcomm SA8155P or NVIDIA DRIVE Orin.
- **Knowledge Graph Reasoning**: Encodes vehicle rules, environmental effects, and traffic laws.
- **Quantized LLM (3-bit)**: Generates real-time natural language alerts using TinyLlama.
- **Context-Aware Safety Alerts**: Advisories based on speed, terrain, weather, component wear, etc.
- **ASIL-B Certifiable**: Real-time Rust/C engine with <300ms latency.
- **Updatable Road Knowledge**: Syncs with navigation systems or receives OTA KG patches.


## Example Use Case

**Scenario:** Curved highway, rain, high brake temperature

**Input:**
```json
{
  "location": "A45_Curve",
  "speed": "110 km/h",
  "brake_temp": "295°C",
  "weather": "Rain",
  "tire_tread": "2.8mm",
  "active_rules": ["HWY-RAIN-5", "BRAKE-MAX-285"]
}
```

**Output (LLM):**
> "Reduce speed to 90 km/h – wet curve ahead and brake temperature approaching critical limit. Tire grip reduced."
